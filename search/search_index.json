Warning Feature status of Revision Based Upgrades is alpha In this exercise, we will: Install a Kubernetes cluster Install Istio v1.12.5 Deploy the BookInfo sample application to the default namespace. Next, we: Install Istio v1.13.2, triggering solely the upgrade of the ingress gateway (not the workloads) Demonstrate namespace labeling as the mechanism for controlling the desired version of Istio to use for workloads in that namespace. Teardown previous version of Istio, completing the upgrade. Finally, we will demonstrate an alternative to labeling namespaces directly, by using what Istio calls Revision Tags .
