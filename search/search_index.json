In this episode, we explore that avenue. We demonstrate setting up a workstation for local development with Istio. We begin by checking out the code, building it, building the docker images and pushing them to a registry, and finally installing Istio on a local k8s cluster using the published images. Next we demonstrate ways of speeding up the development cycle by running istiod directly from our workstation, bypassing the docker image building and publishing steps. We then show how to configure the Istio codebase in an IDE and step through the code in debug mode. We finish with a discussion of the basics of reading and executing a simple unit test.

This document is an adaptation of the document entitled Canary Upgrades from the official Istio documentation. The BookInfo sample application will serve as the workload under test. Warning Feature status of Revision Based Upgrades is alpha In this exercise, we will: Install a Kubernetes cluster Install Istio v1.12.5 Deploy the BookInfo sample application to the default namespace.

Teardown previous version of Istio, completing the upgrade. Finally, we will demonstrate an alternative to labeling namespaces directly, by using what Istio calls Revision Tags .
